<hr><p>A day to day record of students that ECEs can update with information and observations and parents can see and contact educators as well for any concerns they may have about their children. Educators have access to their class, and can post individual pictures and daily going ons to each student's profile that their families can view, as well as communicate with them.</p><ul>
<li>As a former ECE, I have always noticed that we do not have an adequate way to communicate with parents of our students. Stuff like meals, nap times, and washroom and diaper changes are all marked down on paper and a physical copy is given to parents. Also, in order to communicate with parents about daily happenings, we would usually email or wait until the end of the day.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>I want to have a program that can streamline this process of communicating with parents and them to ECEs.</li>
